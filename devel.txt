Ant-ropy with html5/css/javascript/jquery
=========================================
2014. 09. 10.
- First version in git.
- Separate js file with some dummy function.
- Making ant-ropy19 work:
  - Downloading repast3.0
  - Creating a start.sh script to strt the program.

2014. 09. 14.
- Starting Food class.
- Random placement of one food.
- Gaussian random. (http://stackoverflow.com/a/20161247/21047)
- Several food around a food source.

2014. 09. 17.
- Foods class for static methods of java Food.

2014. 09. 20.
- Food is filled circle instead of rectangle.
- Hive is filled circle instead of rectangle.
- use strict
- Ants and Ant "classes".

2014. 09. 23.
- Ants heading. Calculated with random. Using neighbours array to draw.

2014. 09. 24.
- First timing attempt.
- Ants move, screen is redrawn.

2014. 09. 27.
- Fixing ant step and draw.
- Random walk with bias to the current direction.

2014. 10. 01.
- Object-level init functions are eliminated.
- Measuring running speed of step.
- Optimizing execution with stroke and stroke/fillStyle
repositioning: almost 2x faster - 25 msec - for 1000 ants and 100 foods.
- Offscreen drawing: it does not give any advance: 27 msec. I live it
in the code to have an example off screen drawing.

2014. 10. 02.
- Starting Pheromone class. Repast.Diffuse2D's API is here: https://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/java/repast/api/uchicago/src/sim/space/Diffuse2D.html

2014. 10. 05.
- Fixing line end marker. CR/LF is saved for line end under windows. (Previous saves were OK.)
git shows changes for all lines. emacs CR/LF -> LF : C-x RET f unix (file encoding change)
- Some pheromone functions have been started.

2014. 10. 10.
- Pheromone write/read matrices with random colors are used on 1/4 of the screen for test.
- Moving auxiliary functions to aux.js.
- Moving Pheromone functions to pheromone.js.
- Moving Ant, Ants functions to ant.js.
- Moving Food, Foods functions to food.js.

2014. 10. 15.
- aux.js has been renamed to helper.js as Windows does not allow filenames with any extension and named as aux.
- Using AntSpace with abstract space size. Conversion between space and canvas coordinates.
- AntSpace.center and AntSpace.crop2Space to hide all canvas specific measure.

2014. 10. 16.
- Ants emit pheromone (just a constant).
- Emitted pheromone is drawn.

2014. 10. 17.
- Deleting AntSpace.num2Canvas: drawn objects are more sprite-like
they size does not necessarily match space cell size.
- Better color number conversion with helper.decimalToHexString.
- Better color calculation.

2014. 10. 19.
- Color calculation fixed.
- Pheromone is cellsize drawn and correctly positioned on the grid crossing.
- Pheromone is on a new canvas layer.

2014. 10. 20.
- Maybe Ants class is unnecessary and everything can be solved with
static tags of Ant?
- Diffusion: nothing visible (TODO check), slows down to 120 ms.

2014. 10. 22.
- Diffusion constant was 0.86 and evaporation rate was 0.01 during
Repast simulations.
- Diffusion calculation was based on Diffuse2D, a class in
Repast. However the code of computeVal was rewritten and resides in
the own source trunk.
- Pheromone.step = { diffuse();, calculate(); /*(ant pheromone)*/, update(); } is
the correct order, it was used in Repast as well.

2014. 10. 31.
- Using correct diff and evap constants.
- Calculation is based on own Diffuse2D.
- Fix: using rgb for fillstyle instead of '#' prefixed hexadecimal numbers.

2014. 11. 02.
- getEmittedPheromone -> getEmittedPheromoneHive
- getEmittedPheromoneHive is a decreasing function and takes Hive into account.
- Using get/set in Ant and Food for position.
- Code cleanup.
- Introduction of pheromoneFood (unfortunate code duplication in pheromone.js).

2014. 11. 05.
- Hive in a separate hive.js.
- Every js script has use strict at the beginning.
- Main init and step are embedded in a new Antropy object.
- Antropy-related global variables became the member of Antropy object.
- All AntSpace functions became static.
- CanvasData object collects canvas, ctx information. (width, height are deleted and calculated.)
It is used for main canvas.
- CanvasData object for pheromone canvas. Somehow document.getElementById does not work inside canvasdata.js.
- Position of food using get2DGaussian is not correct.
- CanvasData contains offcanvas variables.
- Food and Hive pheromone appears on the same canvas context as green and blue components.

2014. 11. 09.
- Position of food using get2DGaussian has been corrected.
- Fixing getElementById working inside canvasdata.js. One this was missing before canvas and naked canvas had a default value.

2014. 11. 13.
- Particle object is parent of Ant and Food.
- Particle object is parent of Hive as well.
- AntSpace.crop2Space works in one dimension.
- Hiding AntSpace.crop2Space inside Particle.
- Particle has canvasPos2D calling AntSpace.point2Canvas. Ant, Food, Hive use canvasPos2D.
- Particle object is parent of Foods as well.
- Particle object has draw function. All descendants are using it with extension.
- Pheromone refactored to avoid duplication of pheromone calculation.
- Food is carried by the ants.
- Stocked food is counted.
- Start/Stop link.

2014. 11. 16.
- Maxmove for ants.

2014. 11. 20.
- Alert window after mouse click with coordinates on the canvas and food/hive pheromone data.

2014. 11. 21.
- Using david bau's seedrandom: https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom/blob/master/seedrandom.js
- Textfield for seed.

2014. 11. 23.
- Textfield seed is correctly used.
- Reset button.
- Design updates.
- Showing number of ants by working mode.
- Ant number is a configuration parameter.

2014. 12. 19.
- Better debug: 3*3 food and hive pheromone matrix after canvas click.
- Step button.

2014. 12. 29.
- Ant selection.
- Basic data for selected ant.

2015. 01. 02.
- Pheromone data around selected ant.

2015. 01. 12.
- Some styling.
- Selected ant id is clarified.
- Selected ant is drawn at the end.
- Fix: food distribution correctly behaves when logical canvas size is changed.
- Pheromone debug matrix is drawn after matrix transposition.
- Full debug matrix is created and commented out.
- First (0th) ant is selected by default.
- Changing helper.js/gauss_random to a more standard distribution.
- Fixing ant move functions.

2015. 03. 20.
- Food carrying ants have green border.
- Number of steps is displayed.
- Selected ant's heading is displayed.
- helper.js's decimal_pad is padding correctly for integral numbers.
- Fixing heading setting bug.
- Max food number is displayed.

2015. 03. 26.
- ALL COLLECTED is displayed when all food is collected.
- Food number is a parameter.
- More than one possible food source (parameter).
- Configuration variables are directly read from index.html instead of cascading down as function parameters.

2015. 05. 15.
- Design changes: fieldset for border label, disabled input fields for data, bigger canvas, canvas is on the left.

2015. 06. 28.
- What is this? link with help.html page.
- Pheromone debug data and selected ant alert window are commented out.

2015. 07. 01.
- Link to paper.
- Deploy.

2015. 07. 07.

2015. 10. 03.
- Showing food entropy in a new textfield.
- Design cleanup.
- Adding tabular configuration panels from http://codepen.io/wallaceerick/share/zip/ojtal/ (original list: http://designscrazed.org/html5-css3-accordion-tabs/).
